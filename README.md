# Mini-libc

Build a minimalistic*- [standard C library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) implementation for Linux systems (named mini-libc), that can be used as a replacement for the system libc*- (glibc in Linux). The goal is to have a minimally functional libc with features such as string management, basic memory support and POSIX file I/O.

The implementation of mini-libc will be freestanding, i.e. it will not use any outside library calls. It will be implemented on top of the system call interface provided by Linux on an x86_64 architecture. Any function you require, that is typically part of libc, you will have to implement. You can reuse functions that you implement in other parts of the mini-libc.
